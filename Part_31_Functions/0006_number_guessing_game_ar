Number Guessing Game Application Requirements
---------------------------------------------
1. Define the purpose of the application.
   a. Create a game where a computer randomly chooses a number between
      1 and 9.  The player will enter a choice and will get 3 guesses
      and a hint with a short message indicating they are too high or
      too low if they do not guess the right number.
2. Define the rules of the application.
   a. If the player guesses the number they win.
   b. If the player does not guess the right number they get 3
      hints and if they get it they win otherwise lose.
3. Define the logical steps of the application.
   a. Create a turns_left var and init to 3.
   b. Create a guess_number function to obtain guess and return it.
   c. Create a did_win function with params f_guess, f_correct_answer and
      f_turns_left and it will return turns - 1 or a message to indicate a win.
   d. Create a text intro explaining the game and rules.
   e. Create an answer var and obtain a random number between 1 and 9.
   f. Create a guess var and init to 0.
   g. Create a game loop with logic to obtain a players guess and 
      and logic to allow for a max of 3 turns and conditional
      logic to check if they have run out of turns then display a message
      they are out of turns and if there are turns left another message
      to guess again.
